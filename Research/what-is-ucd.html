                Users are the key for any product, that’s why you always to find your target group in order to make the product suit the users. Finding out who your target group is can be hard, usually you’ll have a general idea who your target group is. Making surveys can be a really good way to find out who your target group is or giving an insight on who your target group might be. For our assignment we had to determine the target group for a company and we choose TikTok, which in hindsight wasn’t the best choice because the target group is quite large. But we started by doing some web research to get a general idea of who uses the app by looking at statistics, based on the information we found we proceeded by making a survey, which gave us enough information combined with the web research to make personas. Our target group consists of people around the age 18-24 with over 50% off them being females. </p>

                For this research I used the CMD methods literature study and online analytics. I used literature study to get a general idea of the target group and then I used online analytics to go into the details like finding out which gender uses Tiktok the most and which age group is more prominent. Other research methods that I could have used are trend analysis and focus group. If we had used trend analysis we might have gotten better data on the analytics we studied, since a trend could have been inflating the data at that moment, and the other way around you can also check if it isn’t a trend and that it’s just normal behavior of the data. Focus group would have been really good to gather feedback from actual users, since they can tell personal experiences and having a larger group will help people get “loose” and not be afraid to say something.                     </p>
