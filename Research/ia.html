        <div class="content">
            <p id="intro">
                To get to know informational architecture we had to make an assignment in which we compared different websites while trying to complete the same task, in order to find out what is different between those websites, but before I could start that I had to know what informational architecture is and it’s actually really simple and the name says it architecture for information, so in short how all of the information is organized and divided on the website.            </p>
            <embed src="Information Architecture.pdf" type="application/pdf" > 
            <p id="conclusion">
                From this research I was able to conclude the following and that is that all web shops actually are really similar in terms of how they organize everything, almost all the categories are the same, even if the website is originally for clothes, but they also happen to have started to sell some clothes. Which I thought was pretty interesting, considering you can do anything you want. But as I noticed almost everything was easy to find and that’s probably why they are using the same format. For this research I used web research to find everything I needed, but I could have used the CMD method peer review, since I got stuck multiple times on what I had to do and when you’re stuck it helps a lot to see what other people are doing.            </p>
