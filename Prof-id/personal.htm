                Over the course of this semester I am proud to say that I learned a lot, from all of my teacher, I ended up with a website, which I can be proud of, even though a lot of things can be better. I learned how to use a camera, I know how to do research, I can create a good website with html and CSS and I can do some stuff in JavaScript.
                There off course are things I could have done better. I should have be working on my portfolio more consistent over the entire semester, because then I would have had a more finished product, I should go to my teachers more often for feedback and don just think that I know what they are going to say, even though I end up being correct. Overall I should put a bit more effort into school every day, to lessen the workload in weekend, where I end having to do a lot of stuff.
                I will try to keep doing the same planning as I did during this semester, but then actually for every week, since it gives me a lot more rest in my mind, since I know what is coming up. Iâ€™ll also try to keep using work ethic that I have, but this time divided over more days. As last I think that next group project I have to step up more in moments where there is a lack of leadership, to try to get the project back on rails
