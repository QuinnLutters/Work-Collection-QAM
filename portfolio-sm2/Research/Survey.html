                In order to get a better idea of what our target group wants we made a survey. Surveys can be a really good cmd method to gather a lot of information relatively easy, since you can send it out pretty easily online without a lot of effort. But for us it was a bit harder than usual, since we had to target parents are harder to get a hold of online, since younger people are online more. Luckily we were still able to get some answers, which meant that we could start making some user requirements.            </p>

            <p id="conclusion">
                The survey was had to make, since we had quite the niche market to try to target and therefore coming up with some questions was a bit of a struggle, but we did succeed in gathering some useful feedback about our users. The parents would buy toys for their kids in a window of once every 1 week or month and they prefer plushie toys and the toys shouldn’t be to expensive. Next to using the CMD method survey we could have also used competitive analysis and expert interview, with both of these CMD methods, we would have found out more about our users and “where” they are and what they would want. We would have been able to improve and maybe expand our survey according to the data we would have gathered from that research to improve the data from the surveys.            </p>
