            <p id="intro">
                If you do any research it is also important to put all the information you’ve gathered into a report, since this allows you to have a place where you can go back to see what you’ve done and how this can help you. Before I started to make my research report I did some research into research reports, since I didn’t know where to start. For this research I used literature study, since I wanted to do find some studies where they talked about how to make one and what you can put into it. I actually found something really useful from an American university which gave me an example on how I could make a research report.            </p>

                For this report we could have used the CMD method quality review, since we didn’t really check the final product, since we were in a time restraint, but also since people had to do different tasks then they were appointed, because other people didn’t do their part, or didn’t even bother to take part to start with. Therefore this would have heled a lot, since we were all over the place and then it’s a great help if you just slow down check everything and if it’s up to standard and then you can move on by improving the product, or it’s good and you can deliver it.            </p>
