                After we finished our project plan we still had some questions about our project, since we had the idea that our client didn’t have a good idea of what she wanted and therefore she wanted multiple things that didn’t go together. We decided to conduct an interview with her in order to find out what she wanted and to answer our main and sub questions. While I was making the interview questions I asked some feedback to my teacher about my questions and he had a few questions about some questions, since some weren’t clear. I was able to answer every question and further explain our question and he told me that instead of knowing what the question means in my head, I should note the entire question down and what I mean with each question, in order to get clear answer from our client.            </p>

            <p id="conclusion">
                From this interview we had a better idea of what our client wanted and we concluded the following from this interview. Our client wants us to make a website targeted at parents and museums, she doesn’t want it to be just a web shop of her products and she liked our idea about having a gallery page instead of a more traditional product page. She wants us to include her on the website with some information about her etc. and she wants us to include a game on the website. We won’t be able to do all of this, adding a game for example would be an extra in our opinion. For the interview I of course used the CMD method Interview, but I could have used another one as well to improve our interview. Peer review would have been really good, since we have different groups with the same client and therefore it can be a powerful insight to know what other groups make from our clients answers and feedback and to see what questions they have. This would have made our interview even better, but I was satisfied with it the way it turned out.        </div>
