                Working in a group with colleagues or fellow students, will always be a struggle, since everyone ha a different opinion and you don’t have entire control over what someone is doing, so you’ll have to be able to adapt because of that. You’ll have to treat your colleagues with respect and they’ll show it back and they will also be able to help you in that case.
                In our group everything wasn’t all good, of course we had some hick ups here and there, but we set guidelines, which we all tried to attend to, which made it a lot better. We also crated group roles, since we noticed that it didn’t go as planned at the start, but we didn’t really do anything with them. Which led in sometimes a lack of leadership, but everyone did their best, which helped a great lot to get things done.
                If I would have to do this project again, then I would make sure to make clear roles and use them, as well as being more strict and a bit more professional, in order to make everything to go a bit smoother, since we did have a great team.
