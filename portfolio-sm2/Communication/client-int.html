        <h1>Communicating with client</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p id="intro">
                When you are working with a client it is really important to communicate good with your client, since you will be getting paid by the client in the real world to deliver a product, which the client requested. So you’ll have to satisfy your client and communicate with them to know what they want and to keep them satisfied, but also to ask them about the things your making, asking for their opinion, because nobody will like their client saying I don’t like this on the day you delivered the product and that it is a vital part of your product. 
                Therefore we started of by getting to know our client, she presented her project and told us what she wanted and expected from us. After this we could start on our project, but we still had the idea that we missed some information, so therefore we conducted an interview to answer any of the following questions we had to answer our sub and main questions. After this interview we had a good idea of what our client wanted, so we proceeded.
                The last time we talked to our client was just after we made our prototypes in figma to ask for her opinion and to pick one she liked the most, since we made two versions. Our client was happy about what we made, but I think that we should have talked to our client on more occasions, since three times is a bit little and your client is one if not the most important part of your project.
