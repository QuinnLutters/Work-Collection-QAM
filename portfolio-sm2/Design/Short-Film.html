        <h1>Shortfilm "The Dream"</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p id="intro">
                In our short film we try to capture a dream, our main character has a normal evening and goes to bed after reading a book and when he goed to bed he enters a dream and he pops into a parking garage and from there on the dream gets crazier, we tried to make a somewhat cinematic film, while also keeping it kind of loose and fresh to see. We didn’t ant to make a stale slow paced film, which makes you loose your attention after 2 seconds. We started with brain storming about the movie and noting down everything we liked. We turned this into a script, which I started of with and I made by using the script of ten years a slave, since I didn’t know how to make script. After the script was finished we made storyboards of everything that we had started to doodle and we had a plan for our film, so we could start filming. We filmed using an iPhone 12 in 4k 60fps, since the screens we’ll be watching this on will mostly be 60hz or higher and the higher resolution meant that we are able to zoom into the shots without losing too much quality during the editing.            </p>

            <p id="conclusion">
                The actual filming was quite the task, since we didn’t use the script as a strict plan in the start, which we should have done. During the film I kind of ended up directing the film, which was quite hard, since I also had to play the main character and it didn’t help that I’m not good at explaining what shot we needed to make and how to make it.            </p>
