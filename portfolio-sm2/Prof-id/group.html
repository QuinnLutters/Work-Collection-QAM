            <p id="intro">
                When your working in a group project not everything is going to go the way you want. People will not be able to do work or work that is done will not be good enough and things will go wrong.
                My group off course wasn’t an exception for this, but you’ll have to be able to adapt for this, you need to be able step in if something needs to be finished and someone’s not doing it, since it’s more important that it is finished. We had these issues a lot in the beginning phase of the project, which was annoying, but also a good learning experience. Since you’ll also have these issues when you have a real job and have to work on a project with someone. Because of this I learned that you need to have a lot of patience an most of the time someone just doesn’t know how to do something and then decide to not do it, this isn’t the best solution, but then you’ll have to step in and help that person.
                We also had a client, which was hard to deal with, since she didn’t know what she really wanted from us and therefore she said yes on everything and wanted a lot. This is also a good learning experience, since you’ll have these kind of clients and the most important thing to remember is that you’re the expert, so you know what to do, so don’t ask you client about their target group. Because most don’t understand and will say multiple target groups which won’t go together at all.
