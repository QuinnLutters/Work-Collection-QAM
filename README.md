# Virtual Buddy App


## Description


Welcome to the Virtual Buddy App!


The Virtual Buddy App is designed to help you manage your stress effectively using advanced AI technology and a user-friendly interface. Our goal is to make stress management easy and accessible for everyone. The app offers three main features:


- **Chatting AI**: Interact with a virtual buddy, resembling a gameboy with a smiley face, that provides personalized advice and support to help you manage your stress levels. The AI buddy engages in friendly conversations and offers tailored tips to reduce stress. You can not only hear him but also see the texts he says.


- **Stress Level Summary**: Track your stress levels over time with detailed summary pages. The app provides easy-to-read charts and graphs that give you insights into your stress patterns, helping you understand and manage your stress better.


- **Calendar Integration**: The app integrates with your calendar to suggest activities that fit into your schedule. These personalized activity suggestions are created by AI and designed to help you reduce stress and maintain a healthy routine by analyzing your stress level data.

## Project Status
The project is not yet complete due to time constraints. We have finalized the entire UI design, which has undergone multiple rounds of testing. However, regarding the features, they currently function independently rather than being fully integrated. In the 'virtual_buddy_app_design' directory, which serves as the main directory, you can observe the following:


The calendar MVP is operational.
The stress level page can retrieve data from the smartwatch sensor but has not yet been analyzed by the AI to generate charts.
The AI chatting feature is functional in the 'virtual_buddy' directory but has not been integrated into the main design.
