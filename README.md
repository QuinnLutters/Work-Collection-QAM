# Work-Collection-QAM

## Description
Welcome to my work collection  

This git includes all projects relevant to my personal development that I can show at this moment. Therefore, some things will be outdated.  

This git includes:  
* Second semester portfolio: Review my work and progress from my second semester in 2023.  
* Divoom-Ditoo website: Take a look at some of my first websites in which I used a tiny bit of JavaScript.  
* Codenames game: Play a game of Codenames and see how I created the entire game using JavaScript (but keep the score yourself).  
* Blender Dioramas: Take a look at my creations in Blender, which I probably put too much time into.  
* Virtual Buddy stress management app: Take a look at a Flutter app I created with a group to help with stress management.  
* DRIVEN driving learning app: Find out what we came up with to help improve the passing rates for driving exams.
